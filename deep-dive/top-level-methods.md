# Top-Level Methods

There are a number of top-level methods that can be called directly from the `CrystGLFW` module. They are invoked as follows:

```crystal
require "crystglfw"

CrystGLFW.method_name
```
Some of these methods can be invoked outside of a `run` block definition for configuration purposes.
