# Introduction

Welcome to the guides for CrystGLFW - an object-oriented API for GLFW written in Crystal. These guides should get you familiar enough with the API to make you dangerous, and are intended to serve as a somewhat pragmatic alternative to the [docs](https://calebuharrison.github.io/CrystGLFW/).

This guide assumes that the reader is somewhat acquainted with Crystal - installation of the language, initialization of projects, and the directory structure of a Crystal project are not covered here. If you need a refresher on these topics, check out the [Crystal Language docs](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/).

Even though you don't have to touch a lick of C to use CrystGLFW, it may be helpful to give the [official GLFW documentation](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick_guide.html) a look. Some of the design decisions behind CrystGLFW may be confusing without an understanding of GLFW, though this guide will attempt to explain things as thoroughly as possible. Much of this guide is adapted from the official GLFW documentation.

Contributions to the project are welcome and encouraged, especially in the case that something seems to be working improperly. Consider adding an issue on the [GitHub project](https://github.com/calebuharrison/CrystGLFW) if something doesn't work as expected.

Let's get to it!
